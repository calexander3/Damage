    <p><h3>Damage.IO</h3>
        When Google sunset the iGoogle homepage, I was unable to consume the web content in the manner that I had for so many years. None of the replacements I tried suited my needs. If you are here, I assume the same is true for you. Damage can help.</p>

    <p>
        <h3>Why are there so few gadgets?</h3>
        I have only been working on this project for a few months in my spare time. I would like to eventually create a way for developers to submit gadgets to me. However, the platform needs quite a bit of work before that can happen.
    </p>

    <p>
        <h3>Why does Damage.IO ask for so much access to my Google account?</h3>
        Currently, I have to ask for all permissions that any of the gadgets need, even if you aren’t using those particular gadgets.

        <h3>Something is broken!</h3>
        Please send any issues to <a href="mailto:support@damage.io">support@damage.io</a> along with instructions on how to reproduce the problem. Please keep in mind that I am only one person developing this project in my spare time.
