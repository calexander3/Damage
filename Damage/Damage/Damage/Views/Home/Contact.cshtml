<p>When Google sunset the iGoogle homepage, I became lost. I was unable to consume the content of the web in the manner that I had for so many years. None of the replacements that I tried suited my needs. I created Damage.IO to restore my workflow to its former glory.</p>

<p>
<h3>Why are there so few gadgets?</h3>
I’ve only been working on this project for a few weeks in my spare time. The gadget platform is modular so eventually I want to create a way for developers to submit gadgets to me. However, the platform needs quite a bit of work before that can happen.
</p>

<p>
<h3>Why does Damage.IO ask for so much access to my Google account?</h3>
This is an issue that is at the top of my list. Currently, I have to ask for all permissions that any of the gadgets need, even if you aren’t using those particular gadgets.
</p>

<p>
<h3>Something is broken!</h3>
Please send any issues to <a href="mailto:support@damage.io">support@damage.io</a> along with instructions on how to reproduce the problem. Please keep in mind that I am only one person developing this project in my spare time.
